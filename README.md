Sentence Completion using GPT2


The Sentence Completion using GPT2 Project is a natural language processing (NLP) project that aims to generate coherent and meaningful sentences by completing a given prompt or sentence fragment. The project uses the GPT-2 language model, which is a large transformer-based neural network developed by OpenAI.

The project includes several steps, including data preparation, model training and evaluation, and deployment of the model to a web-based application. The dataset used for training and testing the model includes sentence fragments from a variety of sources, including literature, news articles, and social media.

The GPT-2 model is fine-tuned using the sentence completion task, which involves predicting the most likely next word or phrase given the context of the prompt or sentence fragment. The model is evaluated based on metrics such as perplexity and human evaluation of the generated sentences.

The final model is deployed to a web-based application that allows users to enter a sentence fragment and generate a completed sentence based on the context. The application also provides options for adjusting the length and diversity of the generated sentences.

Overall, the Sentence Completion using GPT2 Project aims to provide a useful tool for generating coherent and natural-sounding sentences, which can be used in a variety of applications, including writing assistance and chatbots.
